# Overshoot
For the overshoot case, the cube is in the same location, however
this time I used the following controller gains:
Kp = 0.8, Ki = 0.5

The greater integral gain and lower proportional gain results in some
overshoot in the transcient response. You can see this in the error 
plots, however much like for the "best" case, there are several spikes
in the error graphs. I am unsure of the origin of these spikes, however
the error plots look as they should besides the spikes, as they show some
overshoot and oscillation before converging to close to zero error
