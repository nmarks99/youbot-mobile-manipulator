# Best Result
To achieve this best result, I used a feedforward + PI controller with the following gains:
Kp = 2.0, Ki = 0.03.

As you can see from the error plots, there is a point (or several) in each of the plots where
the error spikes. Frankly I am not sure why this happens, however you can see that the error curves
look good besides these spikes and converge to zero.
